# flappybird
For the "Create your own Game in Python" assignment

This game is an attempt to recreate the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird" by Dong Nguyen
It uses assets from the original such as the bird and pipes.

The bird is controlled with a single button that makes the bird "flap" adding vertical velocity.
the objective is to avoid hitting the pipes that appear at the top and bottom of the screen.

for each pair of pipes the player passes, 1 point is added to the score
the high score is then recorded in the "high_score.txt" file

upon collision with a pipe the player is prompted with a scoreboard that displays the highest score achieved 
and is asked if they would like to replay the game

Controls:
Space or Left Click to flap
